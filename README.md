***OVERVIEW***
The purpose of this project was to analyze various weather stations in Oahu, Hawaii to inquire if it is feasible to open a "surf n' shake" shop year round, as oppposed to seasonally, with investor W.Avy. An indepth analysis of temperature and precipitation trends in Oahu, Hawaii for June and December was completed, as these 2 weather factors are the biggest contributors to optimal outdoor experiences of all types, particularly surfing and beach attendance. In order to accomplish this, the following had to be performed:
1. analyze advanced data storage with Python and Pandas
2. filter the date column of the measurements table from hawaii.sqlite db
3. retrieve temps and precipitation for june and dec
4. convert to a list and create a dataframe 
5. integrate the statistics with the dataframe 
6. create graphs and tables utilizing Python


In figure 1, the temperature and precipitation collected via weather station analysis was observed for the overall trends and translated to graphical format for easy interpretation.
